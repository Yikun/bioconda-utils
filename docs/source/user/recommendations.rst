Recommendations
===============

1. Install `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_, a drop-in
   replacement for conda. Then use `mamba install` and `mamba create`
   instead.

2. Instead of installing into an existing large environment, try creating new,
   separate, smaller environments if it makes sense to do so.
